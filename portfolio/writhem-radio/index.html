          <p>Grooveshark was my favourite music app for a long time, for 1 reason: <a href="https://twitter.com/writhem" target="_blank">Writhem Radio</a>. The station was my go to for chill programming music when I got bored of my regular music library and wanted to discover something new. Following the closure of Grooveshark, Writhem Radio is prepping a new radio site to host their great music. With that in mind, I decided to design what I thought what Writhem Radio's iOS app might look like.</p>
